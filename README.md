## Project Description
Write a short description of your project. Write 1-2 sentences about what what you chose to build and why. 

The game is about how fast and accurate you can type text. So, the user will type through a group of words, and if the word is typed correctly during the allowed time, the user gets a score. The game enables less time, as the user advance to another group of words. In the end, the score will show up if the user wins or lose.

## Organization
How did you organize yourself? Did you use any tools?
We pick up other recommendations from stackoverflow.com, specifically learn how to do the time part. Also, we wanted to push the limits and tried to visualise the words in a screen.
